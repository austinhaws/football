[ ] apply injury

[ ] add a "check injuries" button - at end of each quarter, roll a d4 for each player that is injured and lower their injuries by that amount to see if they are aviallbe to play again

[ ] add player
[ ] delete player
[ ] year end upgrades and drafting upgrade

•end of year upgrading
up all ages by one year

[ ] year end
• determine if getting +/-
1) 50/50 @ average career length
	+10 each year over
	-10 each year under
2) roll on increase type chart: if result is less than 0, then player retires
3) roll for change and apply to player (never below 0)

[ ] Rolling
	each player rolls 3d6 and adds run/pass for offense/defense
	offense: doubles and won then go 20 yards; triples = move number rolled
	defense: triples = turn over
	one player gets the bonus d4 dice for having picked run/pass right
	roll injury dice - d20 and === 1? 1:20 chance seems like one per game
		roll for which player got injured - if that player type is not playing then try again
		Run play
		QB - 10
		WR - 15
		RB - 65
		OL - 90
		FB - 100

		special

	roll penalty dice - offense and defense : if both penalty then replay down
		1:10 seems less likely of an occurrence



[ ] rules: on 2 pt conversion, defense always gets bonus dice
[ ] kicker is the # of retries?
[ ] punter is the +/- max possible: pick before rolling


make cards have run/pass on their back and run/back underneath. that way can be tricky and look like running, but actually passing.


[ ] drafting
	each player gets a "draft level" telling what types of rolls they will get when made
	level 1 : <= 5% : d4 on both
	level 2 : <= 10% : d4 on one
	level 3 : <= 25% : d3 on both
	level 4 : <= 40% : d3 on one
	level 5 : <= 70% : d2 on both
	level 6 : <= 100% : d2 on one
	* chance of run/pass by position
	QB: 50/50
	WR: 25/75
	RB: 75/25
	OL: 50/50
	FB: 75/25
	DL: 50/50
	LB: 50/50
	CB: 25/75
	S: 15/85

did 2 guys per position for a 4 team draft
[ ] starting teams:
	• roll d6 for years for each player
	• randomly select 5 playres that get a d6 added to either run or pass (50% chance either)
