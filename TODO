	each player gets a "draft level" telling what types of rolls they will get when made
	level 1 : <= 5% : d4 on both
	level 2 : <= 10% : d4 on one
	level 3 : <= 25% : d3 on both
	level 4 : <= 40% : d3 on one
	level 5 : <= 70% : d2 on both
	level 6 : <= 100% : d2 on one
	* chance of run/pass by position
	QB: 50/50
	WR: 25/75
	RB: 75/25
	OL: 50/50
	FB: 75/25
	DL: 50/50
	LB: 50/50
	CB: 25/75

	• roll d6 for years for each player
	• randomly select 5 playres that get a d6 added to either run or pass (50% chance either)
