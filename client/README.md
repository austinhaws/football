run a ncaa bracket using your own teams

Setup your base 64 teams and run them through a bracket. Dice rolls are setup to match odds of teams winning NCAA based on their rank. This way the bracket should get similar results to a real bracket.

This is a great tool for a tech office that doesn't care about college basketball but gets excited about squaring off Star Wars vs Star Trek to see who would win, Kirk or Vader.
